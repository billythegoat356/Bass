# Bass
A framework for generating ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha) subtitles easily.

## Note
Due to the poorly documented syntax of the ASS format, I decided to make this framework to help creating ASS subtitles simply.   
*Note that Bass does **not** parse, read, or render ASS subtitles. Use FFmpeg (or rather [OVNI](https://github.com/billythegoat356/OVNI)) for that.*
